# JCIO
This is JCIO, a moddable command line. JCIO can be used as a regular command line, but has lots of features and you can make your own plugins as well as import other plugins (See the wiki). It can be used for creating text-based games/music creation/drawing ASCII-art/and a lot more, 'The only limit is your imagination'.
This Github repository contains not only the source code, but also a Wiki. But if you still have any questions, feel free to ask! I'd also love to hear suggestions for possible features and feedback is really appreciated.

###Note:
The current version is in alpha, this means things will change. Such changes may break your plugin.

### Features:
* Moddable - Making a plugin is really easy and you don't need a lot of knowledge about Java.
* Settings - There are settings to customize your console.
* Utils - There are lots of utilities to use in your plugins.
* Input - There is keyboard and mouse input, but you can also simulate key presses, mouse presses, etc.
* Custom - The window is completely Java, so there is a lot of customization.
* And there is much more!

### Ideas:
* Add more plugins.
* Add more settings.
* Add a databse system.
* Add more utils.
* Add a popup-system.
* See the [trello page](https://trello.com/b/dejbqg0f) for all ideas, things to do, etc.
