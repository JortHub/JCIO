# JCIO
This is JCIO, a moddable command line. JCIO can be used as a regular command line, but has lots of features and you can make your own plugins as well as import other plugins (See: Wiki). It can be used for creating text-based games/music creation/drawing ASCII-art/and a lot more, 'The only limit is your imagination'.
This Github repository contains not only the source code, but also a Wiki. But if you still have any questions, feel free to ask! I'd also love to hear suggestions for possible features and feedback is really appreciated.

### Features:
* Moddable - Making a plugin is really easy and you don't need a lot of knowledge about Java.
* Settings - There are settigs to customize your console.
* More added soon!

### Ideas:
* Add a PluginManager plugin
* Add a Music creating plugin
* Add keyboard input
* Add more settings
